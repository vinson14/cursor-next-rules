# Cursor Rules

## General Coding Standards

- Write clean, maintainable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the existing code style in the project

## Code Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JavaScript/TypeScript, 4 spaces for Python)
- Remove trailing whitespace
- Use single quotes for strings unless double quotes are required
- Add trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays

## Best Practices

- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use async/await over promises when possible
- Handle errors appropriately
- Write self-documenting code

## File Organization

- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Use descriptive file names
- Organize imports: external libraries first, then internal modules
- Export only what's necessary
