In this Next.js repository, we will have the following folders:

-   `@ui` or `@ui/*` for reusable UI components (e.g., `@ui/button`, `@ui/dialog`). These should only contain components that can be re-used across the entire repository.
-   `@features` or `@features/*` for feature components (e.g., `@features/projects` resolves to index.tsx). A feature is usually complex and has its own folder. Within the feature folder:
    -   The main file should be within an `index.tsx` file
    -   Split required functions, handlers, hooks, etc. into separate files within the same folder
    -   The `index.tsx` file should be a composition of all those together with reusable components and functions from `@ui`, `@hooks`, `@lib`, etc.
    -   Anything that is specific to a particular feature should be placed inside the feature folder
-   `@layout` or `@layout/*` for reusable layout components (e.g., `@layout/MainLayout`). These should only contain layouts that can be re-used across the entire repository.
-   `@hooks/*` for reusable hooks (e.g., `@hooks/useExample`). These should only contain hooks that can be re-used across the entire repository.
-   `@lib/*` for reusable utilities (e.g., `@lib/apiClient`). These should only contain utilities that can be re-used across the entire repository.
-   `@types/*` for reusable types (e.g., `@types/user`). These should only contain types that can be re-used across the entire repository.
